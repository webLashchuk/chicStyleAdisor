          Personal Experience

        <p>
          Welcome to the world of style! Hailing from the beautiful city of San Francisco, I've always been surrounded
          by a creative atmosphere and a variety of fashion trends. My interest in fashion and style began in early
          childhood, spending hours poring over magazines and fashion shows. This innate interest led me to keep up with
          trends and become a stylist, helping people express themselves through their style.
        </p>

        <p>
          My passion for style was further fueled by participating in numerous events and collaborating with renowned
          designers and stylists, confirming my decision to pursue a career in professional styling.
